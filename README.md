# Schedule-calculator

Just a way to convert from decimal to hours and minutes.

My coworkers and I were getting tired of having the boss
not telling us how much time we were up/under until the last
minute.

Maybe future calculators will go day-by-day, filling in individual
days with the times worked. 

The other issue we have is our time is not updated
until midnight and we work overnight so maybe a way to calculate the
amount of time we have worked in an individual day to add to the total...
That way we can see how much time we need to cut/stay if we have the opportunities
to do so.
